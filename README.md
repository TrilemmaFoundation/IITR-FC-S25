# Improving Bitcoin Accumulation Strategies
IIT Roorkee Finance Club Summer 2025

**IITR-FC-S25**

Welcome to the Trilemma Foundation x IIT Roorkee Finance Club repository. This project challenges students to go beyond Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and build data-driven models for optimizing Bitcoin accumulation. The emphasis is on improving existing models for real-world deployment.

## üîç Why: Problem Statement

The world‚Äôs most influential entities‚Äîincluding asset managers, financial institutions, and sovereign wealth funds‚Äîare actively accumulating Bitcoin or investigating strategies to do so. This nascent accumulation race underscores a fundamental game-theoretic principle: as others acquire a mathematically scarce asset, the incentive to participate intensifies.

While Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) remains a widely utilized approach, it may prove suboptimal amid such competitive dynamics. This project seeks to design data-driven accumulation strategies that retain the key advantages of DCA‚Äînamely, consistent and systematic purchases‚Äîwhile enhancing the efficiency of Bitcoin acquisition with \$1M+ monthly budgets across multi-year time frames. The resulting insights can be delivered through a SaaS integration or hedge fund product, ultimately giving high-AUM investors access to these accumulation strategies.

## üì¶ What: Project Objectives


## Project Objectives

### 1. Understand the Problem Statement

* **Purpose**: Build foundational understanding of the challenge at hand.
* **Goal**: Read through the repo and briefly review the model development template to get a clear sense of what you‚Äôll be working on.
* **Deliverable**: None ‚Äî this is a warm-up to align your intuition with the project scope.

---

### 2. Gather Domain Knowledge

* **Purpose**: Equip yourself with basic knowledge of Bitcoin and its ecosystem.
* **Goal**: Read Chapters 1 & 2 of *Mastering Bitcoin* by Andreas Antonopoulos. No prior experience required ‚Äî this will help take you from 0 to 1.
* **Deliverable**: None ‚Äî this supports your ability to reason about the problem context.

---

### 3. CoinMetrics EDA

* **Purpose**: Get hands-on with our base dataset and extract useful signals.
* **Goal**: Perform exploratory data analysis on the CoinMetrics dataset provided in our pipeline.
* **Deliverable**: A Jupyter Notebook that visualizes and uncovers patterns relevant to smart Bitcoin accumulation.

---

### 4. Extended EDA + Data Contributions

* **Purpose**: Identify gaps in the CoinMetrics dataset and explore alternatives.
* **Goal**: Perform a generalized EDA using any open-source data. If you discover data that meaningfully supports the challenge, submit a PR to include it in the project pipeline.
* **Why it matters**: This is arguably the most impactful part of the project ‚Äî your contributions will extend the core dataset powering our Bitcoin tournaments, which will be used by thousands of participants globally.
* **Deliverable**: Notebook demonstrating your analysis, and optionally, a pull request adding new data to the challenge.

---

### 5. Model Development (Starts June 28)

* **Purpose**: Design and implement accumulation strategies based on your insights.
* **Goal**: Submit your model code to the official challenge starting June 28. Participation is optional but highly encouraged.
* **Deliverable**: Strategy code submitted via [Hypertrial.ai](https://www.hypertrial.ai/) following the challenge format.

---

### 6. Strategy Fact Sheet (Final Deliverable)

* **Purpose**: Communicate your strategy‚Äôs performance and reasoning effectively.
* **Goal**: Create a concise fact sheet that highlights how your strategy outperforms baselines, supported by data and visualizations.
* **Deliverable**: A one-page fact sheet plus a Python notebook that reproduces the results shown.

---

## üöÄ How: Project Culture

### Work in Public, Commit in Private

* While this is an **open-source project**, we ask each team to push their weekly progress to the **private repository** provided (e.g., `IITR-FC-{n}`)
* These repos are private during the challenge and will be made public after the model deadline passes.
* If nothing is being pushed, we assume no work is being done.

### Show Initiative

* **Ask questions** in Discord or during weekly office hours.
* We‚Äôre here to help‚Äîbut your **progress determines how much support we can provide**.
* Share what you're learning, even if it's messy‚Äî**insight comes from iteration**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Check our Discord for onboarding details.
2. Read Chapters 1 & 2 of [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook).
3. **Review the [Data Retrieval Notebook](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-MSA-S25/blob/main/2.%20Data%20Retrieval.ipynb)** to fetch and begin exploring the initial dataset.
4. **Check this repository regularly**, as we will be updating it with new tutorials, resources, and guidance.

## üì£ Final Notes

* Submit all deliverables as Jupyter Notebooks unless otherwise specified.
* All work will be evaluated not only on technical correctness but also on **storytelling, clarity, and educational value**.

Let‚Äôs turn insights into alpha üöÄ
